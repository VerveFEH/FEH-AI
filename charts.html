				<p>This chart shows the requirements for users of various assists to be eligible to perform their assist pre-combat (meaning, while attacks can still be made by anyone on the team). For combat damage calculations, the unit only cares about how much damage it can do and does not account for counter attacks (including dying to vantage before actually doing damage) nor does it account for specials (including AoE specials or defensive specials like Miracle and thus includes overkill). Please note that ineligibility according to game rules (i.e. affected by Isolation) is already implied to result in an invalid assist user.</p>

				<h3>Pre-Combat Heal Eligibility by Heal Amount</h3>
				<p><i>Example: Maria has Physic staff, which heals up to 8 HP. There is a level 1 Felicia with 8/14 HP, and a level 40 Felicia with 28/34 HP. Both can be healed by 6 HP, which is not enough to guarantee pre-combat heal from the previous chart. For a heal amount of 6, a target must otherwise have 20 or less Max HP. So the level 1 Felicia is eligible for pre-combat heal, while the level 40 Felicia is ineligible.</i></p>

				<p>This chart lists skills which inflict miscellaneous debuffs/poison damage and are taken into consideration for the "afflicter" status for an attacker. If a skill inflicts a debuff or does poison damage but is not on this list, it is NOT taken into consideration for the "afflicter" status. Don't ask me why, it seems to be completely arbitrary.</p>
