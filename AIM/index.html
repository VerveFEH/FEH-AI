				<p>Hey guys! Mia here, under the tutelage of Verve (aka /u/rhasta_la_vista). I'm going to share everything that I've learned about the AI in Fire Emblem Heroes. This includes behaviors for all actions such as attacks, assists, and movement. I hope you will use this guide to augment your mastery of tactics in FEH!
				
				<br><br>So to explain a bit how to navigate this site, here's where the links on the left side will take you:</p>
				
					<p class="tab1"><a href="intro.html">Introduction</a> This is an introduction to what the anatomy of a turn looks like for the AI. It will cover the basic operations that take place, but will not delve into the specifics. Its purpose is just to give you a brief overview of the structure of a turn.
					
					<br><br><a href="textguide.html">Plain Text Guide:</a> This is a text-only version of the guide that has no clutter, but is mainly for quick and concise reference if you are already familiar with the rules of AI. It does not explain much or have any examples or pictures, simply the procedures that AI follow.
					
					<br><br><a href="noteguide.html">Annotated Guide:</a> (DISCLAIMER: do not use this page if you are on mobile and on data. It will consume a lot of data) This is where you want to go if you are still learning the ropes with AI. This guide has a lot of notations, equipped with the relevant glossary section for each step and providing practical examples of performing each step.
					
					<br><br><a href="charts.html">Charts:</a> This page stores a few charts that are used in the guide, and are referenced when needed, so it can be useful for reference sometimes.
					
					<br><br><a href="glossary.html">Glossary:</a> This page contains explanations for certain concepts and has a compendium of all tiebreakers used by AI, so it can be useful for reference sometimes.
					
					<br><br><a href="changelog.html">Changelog:</a> Check this page to see if anything gets changed or updated. I'll also try to share what new info is being researched or being added in the future.
					
					<br><br><u>日本語:</u> Changes the language to Japanese. Still under construction, sorry! You will get a 404 if you try to use it at the moment.
					</p>
