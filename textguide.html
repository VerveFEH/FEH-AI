				<p>This is the plain text guide. No examples, images, or clarifications will be given here, simply the bare minimum list of operations for those already familiar with AI rules to easily follow.
				
				<br><br>No Rival Domains/Grand Conquest specific rules at the moment.
				
				<br><br>Disclaimer: I don't claim this guide as the truth, but merely rules that I've determined based on my research. I am liable to mistakes, so please let me know when I've slipped up. Topics I am not 100% certain on: Rival Domains/Grand Conquest exclusive rules.</p>
				
				<p class="bigger" id="step1">I. Evaluate and store turn-wide states:</p>
					<p class="tab1">A. Evaluate and perform obstacle related processes:<p>
						<p class="tab2">1. For each unit, grant "pass" status if it has a skill that allows movement through foe's spaces, and the requirements of the skill is met
						<br>2. Create an Ally Obstacle List (used by enemies), storing the location of all tiles that are occupied by allies
						<br>3. Create an Enemy Obstacle List (used by allies), storing the location of all tiles that are occupied by enemies
						<br>4. Create a Block Obstacle List (used by both sides), storing the location of all tiles that have blocks</p>
					<p class="tab1">B. Create Movement Order List using these tiebreaks:</p>
						<p class="tab2">1. Have assist: N > Y 
						<br>2. Attack type: Melee > Ranged > Weaponless
						<br>3. Distance to closest enemy: lowest #
						<br>4. Slot order: lowest #</p>
					<p class="tab1">C. Store movement range of each unit and enemy which does not have the "pass" status</p>
						
				<p class="bigger" id="step2">II. Assess Threats:</p>
					<p class="tab1">A. If no units have actions, skip to <a href="#step8">Step VIII [End Turn]</a>
					<br>B. For each unit with a weapon equipped, give "threatens enemy" status if at least 1 enemy is in unit's threat range (based on unit's movement stored from step I.C)
					<br>C. For each unit, give "threatened by enemy" status if unit is in at least 1 enemy's threat range. Calculate threat range of each enemy based on enemy's movement range (step I.B) and accounting for blocks based on the Block Obstacle List (step I.A.4), or if an enemy has the "pass" status, use current movement range and factor in obstacles from their respective foes' Obstacle List and the Block Obstacle List(step I.A.2-4)</p><br>
					
				<p class="bigger" id="step3">III. Calculate Combat Results:</p>
					<p class="tab1">A. Create attacker list containing each unit with action that has the "threatens enemy" status; if list is empty, skip to <a href="#step6">Step VI [Evaluate Post-Combat Assists]</a>

					<br>C. For each assister on the list, populate a target list with each ally its assist can be used on
					<br>D. Check each target's pre-combat eligibility using <a href="charts.html#chartB">Chart B</a>
					<br>E. Remove ineligible targets from each assister's target list and remove assisters with no targets from assist list; if assist list is empty, skip to <a href="#step5">Step V [Evaluate Attacks]</a>

If an enemy was defeated OR if an enemy's location was displaced (i.e. drag back, lunge), for each unit with the "pass" status, check if their skill granting "pass" is still active; if not, remove "pass" status from that unit. In addition, for each tile in each Obstacle List (step I.A.2-4), if there is no longer an ally, enemy, or block occupying it, remove that tile from the respective Obstacle List. Clear all states except for those from Step I and return to <a href="#step2">Step II [Assess Threats]</a></p><br>
